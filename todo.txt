## still need to implement: 
- 3rd party enrichment
- test backend more
- readme 

- initialising db? how to go about not? not a good solution yet.

## discussion points:
- go through requirements one by one on UI, then in code
- needed to reverse data in database to add timestamps, and then reverse back on the UI, 
    the reason for this was so that whenever i query data i can sort by most recent timestamps
    this allows newer rows to be at top which makes sense for an invoicing app 
-  make sure to compress images for performance
- multiple sorting is supported: demonstrate with John and Jane Doe


## with more time:
// AG Grid skills showcase 
- persist grid state
- datepicker filter
- pagination
- See AG grid docs, blogs, and HC for ideas to spice it up

// UX/web design practise 
- image edits in modal -> avatar, saving on server etc.
- date formating - 2 days overdue red, 1 week left, 1 month left useEffect
- responsive columns
- form UX
- handle error states
- search bar

// tech im curious about
- nextjs 
- styling with tailwind 
- 3D animations 

// backend practice
- Authentication 
- Deploy ( must change network access https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/64e13d0f7860ee7a5c60d63b#/security/network/accessList)
