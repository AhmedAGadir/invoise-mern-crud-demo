## still need to implement: 
- SSRM
- filter
- sort
- 2 way sort
- external filter
- search bar
- 3rd party enrichment
- tests
- film
- readme 

- initialising db? how to go about not? not a good solution yet.


## discussion points:
- needed to reverse data in database to add timestamps, and then reverse back on the UI, 
    the reason for this was so that whenever i query data i can sort by most recent timestamps
    this allows newer rows to be at top which makes sense for an invoicing app 
- wanted to implement things from refactoring UI book - shimmer card, empty page, text styling 
    would have acc done more on the web design side e.g. form, responsive columns, date formatting 
    but was pressed for time and this is more about showing off grid skills 
-  make sure to compress images for performance


## with more time:
// AG Grid skills showcase 
- pagination
- See AG grid docs, blogs, and HC for ideas to spice it up

// UX/web design practise 
- image edits in modal -> avatar, saving on server etc.
- date formating - 2 days overdue red, 1 week left, 1 month left useEffect
- responsive columns
- form UX

// tech im curious about
- nextjs 
- styling with tailwind 
- 3D animations 

// backend practice
- Authentication 
- Deploy ( must change network access https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/64e13d0f7860ee7a5c60d63b#/security/network/accessList)
